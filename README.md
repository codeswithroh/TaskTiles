# TaskTiles 🎯

TaskTiles is a minimalist, bento box-style todo application that helps you prioritize your day through visual task management. Instead of endless task lists, TaskTiles limits you to three key tasks - small, medium, and large - helping you focus on what truly matters.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Priority Management**: Organize tasks in a beautiful bento grid layout
- **Size-Based Prioritization**: Three task sizes for different priority levels
  - 🟨 Small: Quick wins and minor tasks
  - 🟧 Medium: Standard priority tasks
  - 🟦 Large: Major focus areas and important projects
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks automatically save to localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, distraction-free UI focused on your priorities
- **Quick Editing**: Easy to add, edit, and mark tasks as complete
